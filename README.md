### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer at Infinerotech in Owerri, Nigeria 🌆

- 🧱 I’m currently working on [text_animator](https://github.com/kenresoft/text_animator).

- 🔭 I maintain other cool libraries like: [riff_switch](https://github.com/kenresoft/riff_switch), [jump_list_navigator](https://github.com/kenresoft/flutter_list_navigator), [fontresoft](https://github.com/kenresoft/fontresoft)(currently not public) and [chat_shape](https://github.com/kenresoft/chat_shape).

- 🌱 I’m learning to get even better and be the best in all that I do presently.

- 🧑‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.

- 💬 Ask me about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [Dart](https://dart.dev), [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), [Android](https://developer.android.com), [Java](https://dev.java/), and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like nature and space so much that I would like to go to moon to work on my next project. ✨
