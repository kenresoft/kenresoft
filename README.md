I'm a software developer at Infinerotech in Owerri, Nigeria 🌆

- 🧱 I’m currently working on [RiffSwitch]()

- 🔭 I maintain other cool libraries like: [jump_list](), [chat_shape](), and [fontresoft]()

- 🌱 I’m learning to get better and be the best in all that I do currently.

- 🧑‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects

- 💬 Ask me about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [Dart](https://dart.dev), [Android](), [Java](), and [Kotlin]().

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like nature and space. I would like to go to moon to work on my next project. ✨
